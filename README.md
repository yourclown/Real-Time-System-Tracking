This straightforward MachineWise web dashboard, built by Ankit Prasad (A.P.), uses a Node.js + Express backend and a React.js frontend with Tailwind CSS. The backend generates random sensor data (current, voltage, temperature, vibration) via a /api/sensors endpoint. The frontend fetches this data every 5 seconds using useEffect and setInterval, displays it in a responsive card-based layout, and determines the machine status ("Healthy," "Warning," or "Critical") based on thresholds (temperature > 80°C, vibration > 20 mm/s), shown with color-coded alerts (green, yellow, red).

The status logic is implemented in the frontend to keep the backend lightweight, using mock data for simplicity and separating frontend/backend for modularity. Tailwind CSS ensures a professional, responsive UI. For a production-grade version, I’d replace mock data with real sensor inputs, use WebSockets for real-time updates, add authentication, incorporate charts for data trends, and include tests and accessibility features.
