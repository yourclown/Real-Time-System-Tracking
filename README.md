This straightforward MachineWise web dashboard was constructed using a Node.js + Express backend and a React.js frontend. Via a /api/sensors endpoint, the backend provides simulated sensor data (current, voltage, temperature, and vibration), which is produced at random for every request. Using useEffect and setInterval, the frontend retrieves this data every 5 seconds, shows it, and determines the machine status ("Healthy," "Warning," or "Critical") based on vibration (> 20 mm/s) and temperature (> 80Â°C). To act as a warning when thresholds are exceeded, the status is displayed using color-coded text (green, yellow, and red).

I implemented the status logic in the frontend to keep the backend light, used random mock data for simplicity, and separated the frontend and backend for clarity. I would substitute real sensor data for the mock data in a production-grade version.
